## Sounds fine, what's this?

A personnal game project, partially based on D&D, and medieval fantasy universe in general.
It will feature procedurally generated quests, turn based dice rolling combat mechanics, and a (bad) crazy storyline.

## What does it use?

At the moment, I plan to use only C++ and [NCurses](https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/) ([PDCurses](http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/) for Windows).
The libraries used are subject to changes though, since I may find a cooler (AKA simpler) way to do this on the run.

## Cool, but what's with this name?

That's the only name I came with. I'm deeply sorry.

## Any ideas for future features?

I don't really like to talk for the future, but I may be interresting in making a web version out of it, once the standalone one is finished.
